<h1>Reverse Shell Malware</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Reverse Shell Malware script is a template for creating malicious software designed to establish a reverse shell connection with a remote host. This type of malware allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a victim's computer, execute arbitrary commands, and exfiltrate sensitive information.</p>

<p>With the capability to execute commands remotely, capture screenshots, download files, and maintain persistence on the victim's system, this malware poses a significant threat to cybersecurity.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reverse shell connection: Establishes a connection to a remote host, providing the attacker with control over the victim's computer.</li>
  <li>Command execution: Enables the attacker to execute commands on the victim's computer, such as accessing files, launching applications, and manipulating system settings.</li>
  <li>Screenshot capture: Allows the attacker to take screenshots of the victim's desktop, providing visual insight into the victim's activities.</li>
  <li>File download: Facilitates the download of files from the victim's computer to the attacker's system, potentially containing sensitive information.</li>
  <li>Persistence: Ensures that the malware remains active on the victim's computer even after system reboots, providing continuous access for the attacker.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before using this Reverse Shell Malware template, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python installed on your system.</li>
  <li>Basic understanding of Python programming.</li>
  <li>Compatible listener script installed on your remote host to receive the reverse shell connection.</li>
  <li>SMTP server credentials for sending emails (if using the email functionality).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use the Reverse Shell Malware template, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the required Python libraries by pip</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Modify the script: Open the Python script in a text editor and customize the following parameters:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Replace <code>"YOUR_HOST_IP"</code> with the IP address of your remote host where the listener script is running.</li>
  <li>Replace <code>3131</code> with the port number used by your listener script to accept incoming connections.</li>
  <li>Replace <code>"YOUR_PASSWORD"</code> with a strong password for authentication between the malware and the listener script.</li>
  <li>Replace <code>"your_email@gmail.com"</code> with your email address for sending notifications, screenshots, and downloaded files.</li>
  <li>Replace <code>"YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD"</code> with the password for your email account.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
  <li>Compile the script: Optionally, you can compile the Python script into an executable file using a tool like PyInstaller to make distribution easier.</li>
  <li>Deliver the malware: Distribute the compiled executable file to the target system.</li>
  <li>Execute the malware: Instruct the victim to run the malware on their computer. Once executed, the malware will attempt to establish a reverse shell connection with your remote host.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure that your listener script is running and configured to accept incoming connections on the specified port. Monitor the listener for incoming connections from infected machines.</p>


<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>Upon establishing the reverse shell connection, the attacker can issue the following commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>download &lt;filename&gt;</code>: Initiates the download of a specified file from the victim's computer to the attacker's system. The file is then sent as an email attachment for retrieval.</li>
  <li><code>screenshot()</code>: Triggers the capture of a screenshot of the victim's desktop, which is subsequently sent as an email attachment for review.</li>
  <li><code>cd &lt;directory&gt;</code>: Changes the current working directory on the victim's system, allowing the attacker to navigate the file system.</li>
  <li><code>--help</code>: Displays a list of available commands and usage instructions.</li>
  <li>#Other than special commands like above the shell will also execute any windows system commands succesfully)#</li>
</ul>
